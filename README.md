# Perceptron Algorithm from Scratch for Binary Classification

This repository contains the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm from scratch for a binary classification problem. The repository is organized into two main directories: `Data` and `Code`.
## Perceptron Algorithm Overview
The Perceptron algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It updates its weights based on the misclassification error, iteratively improving the decision boundary until it converges or reaches a specified number of iterations.

## Files

- **Data/annotated_points_np_200.csv**: This file contains the dataset used for  the Perceptron algorithm.
  
- **Code/gui_inputs.py**: This script handles GUI inputs for annotating points for the dataset.
  
- **Code/perceptron_2d_data_rakesh_nemu_version_no_1.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm from scratch.

## Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Ensure that the `annotated_points_np_200.csv` file is placed in the `Data` directory.

2. **Running the GUI**:
   - Navigate to the `Code` directory.
   - Run the `gui_inputs.py` script to input and annotate 200 points.
   
   ```bash
   python gui_inputs.py
3. **Training the Perceptron Algorithm**:
- Open the perceptron_2d_data_rakesh_nemu_version_no_1.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the Perceptron algorithm on the dataset.
- The notebook provides a step-by-step implementation and visualization of the algorithm.
